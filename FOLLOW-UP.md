# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend and backend? What are they used for?

Frontend
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Material-UI: React components for faster and easier web development

Backend
  - Axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js, offers a simple way to make http calls

# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?

About 14 hours

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would like to add unit tests to the backend and frontend, validate invalid parameters (query string for example), show error messages instead of silencing them, and remove inline styles.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

Although I have not added tests, the backend; I believe the code is better than the frontend.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I spent more time with the frontend, React and Material-UI are not libraries I'm used to working with, so I can say I found it more difficult.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.

I think it was a good test overall, but I believe the backend could get more attention. Further instructions on what to achieve to make the requested features acceptable would also help.
